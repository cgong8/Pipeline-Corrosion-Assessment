# Pipeline Corrosion Assessment
This package of codes is used to carry out Level 3 FEM assessment of corroded pipeline capacity.  It allows automatic FEM modeling of actual corrosion with complex shapes, seamless data fusion with on-site 3D laser scanning of corrosion profiles, and inline inspection reports. In addition, it contains several well-known Level 2 approaches such as Psqr and DNV complex etc. Any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at 380680110@qq.com.
